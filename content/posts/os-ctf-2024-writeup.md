## The statue is being repaired

### Description

{{< admonition type=info title="Click to show the desc" open=false >}}
This statue is typical of an university, can you find out the name of the statue and the city where it exists?

Format flag: **OSCTF{name of statue_city}**

If the name of the statue is Statue of Liberty at New York, US, the flag will be: **OSCTF{statueofliberty_newyork}**

![The statue is being repaired-02](/images/os-ctf_osint1-02.png)

- The image looks same, and then I explore the tag in the post `#FPTAround`.
- Seems like it refers to the **FPT University in Vietnam**.

![The statue is being repaired-03](/images/os-ctf_osint1-03.png)

- I do more exploration about **fptaround** and luckily I got the community page in Facebook: [*https://www.facebook.com/fptaround*](https://www.facebook.com/fptaround).

![The statue is being repaired-04](/images/os-ctf_osint1-04.png)

- I try to translate what is the Intro description.

![The statue is being repaired-05](/images/os-ctf_osint1-05.png)

- Nice, we got the city name: **Ho Chi Minh**.
- Next, we've to found what is the statue name. I just search FPT university statue in google, and found the useful wiki link: [*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Self-made_Man_statue_at_FPT_University_Ha_Noi.jpg*](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Self-made_Man_statue_at_FPT_University_Ha_Noi.jpg).
- Alhamdulillah, I got the name of statue: **Self-made man**.

![The statue is being repaired-06](/images/os-ctf_osint1-06.png)

### Solve Walkthrough

- Visit the web page, and open the inspect element in web browser.

![Introspection-01](/images/os-ctf_web1-01.png)

- Notice that the web page have JS file embedded. Open the `script.js` file and yeah.. we found the flag.

`script.js`

```javascript
function checkFlag() {
  const flagInput = document.getElementById('flagInput').value;
  const result = document.getElementById('result');
  const flag = "OSCTF{Cr4zY_In5P3c71On}";
  
  if (flagInput === flag) {
    result.textContent = "Congratulations! You found the flag!";
    result.style.color = "green";
  } else {
    result.textContent = "Incorrect flag. Try again.";
    result.style.color = "red";
  }
}
```

- Check the flag for make sure. Sooo... ez dude.

## 2. Heads or Tails

### Description

{{< admonition type=info title="Click to show the desc" open=false >}}
pfft .. Listen, I've gained access to this login portal but I'm not able to log in. The admins are surely hiding something from the public, but ... I don't understand what. Here take the link and be quiet, don't share it with anyone

### Solve Walkthrough

- From the title we know that the challenge is the web app vulnerable to **SQL injection attack**.
- Just performing basic SQL injection payload to bypass login: `1' OR 1=1--`.
- Use the payload in username and password and it will make the username and password val0id. 4. In the default page, it will show the **fake flag**. You must be careful okay.

![Heads or Tails-01](/images/os-ctf_web2-01.png)

- But, you can access the admin page directly by changing the endpoint to `/admin` (if you know).

![Heads or Tails-02](/images/os-ctf_web2-02.png)

- If you don't know what all endpoints or subdirectories inside the web page, you can do **directory scanning** using tool like **dirsearch**, **feroxbuster**, **dirb**, or **gobuster**. I recommend to use **dirsearch** cause they have default wordlist.

### Solve Walkthrough

- Given a web app that we can see personal information, but notice that every person is have unique id: `?user_id` value parameters.

![Indoor WebApp-01](/images/os-ctf_web3-01.png)

- I try to change it to person **2** or `?user_id=2` and I got the flag.

![Indoor WebApp-02](/images/os-ctf_web3-02.png)

- We can perform brute force attack to check if the spesific `user_id` is exist or not by using **Burp Suite** or simply **cURL** (combined with for/while loop).

![Indoor WebApp-03](/images/os-ctf_web3-03.png)

- Luckily, we just have 3 available users.

- Try to guess common admin passwords, such as:

| Username | Password |

| admin | admin |
| admin | password |
| admin | admin123 |
| admin | admin1234 |
